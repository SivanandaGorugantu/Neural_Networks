# Solving Equations Using Neural Networks

A series of experiments to solve mathematical equations using NNs.

4 equations were solved with a really good accuracy and an effort to optimise and fit the models with as few parameters as possible.

|Equation|Params|Accuracy|
|--------|------|--------|
|2a+6b+c|4|100%|
|2ab+6b+ca| 625| 99.62%|
|ax^2+bx+c| 11,185| 99.94%|
|(a+b)^2 = a^2+b^2+2ab| 11,153|100%|
